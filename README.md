# merge_to_run_tests_in_dir
Some scripts in bash and Python to automate folder-based tests-run.

Sometimes I just want to write some snippets and store them for later. I don't want to put them into a relatively heavy enviroment. So the quickest way to test them I can think of is simply concating the source and tests files and running tests. Especially when I'm on Mac, I can use Automator to just select the folder with the snippet inside and run a Service from the right click.

Scripts here are used together with Automator to realize this process.
